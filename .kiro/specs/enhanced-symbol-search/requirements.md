# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a VSCode extension that provides enhanced symbol search functionality for large repositories where the default language server indexing is insufficient. The extension will replace or supplement the default Cmd+T (Go to Symbol) shortcut by implementing intelligent pattern matching that can find classes, variables, and other code symbols using fuzzy search patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working in a large codebase, I want to search for symbols using partial names with intelligent pattern matching, so that I can quickly navigate to classes and other code elements even when the language server indexing is incomplete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type "AccInv" THEN the system SHALL search for patterns like "class Acc.*Inv.*(" to find matching class definitions
2. WHEN I perform a symbol search THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds for repositories up to 100MB
3. WHEN multiple matches are found THEN the system SHALL display them in a ranked list based on relevance
4. WHEN I select a search result THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the symbol definition in the appropriate file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search for different types of code symbols (classes, functions, variables), so that I can find any code element regardless of its type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a symbol THEN the system SHALL support finding classes, functions, methods, variables, and interfaces
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL indicate the symbol type (class, function, variable, etc.)
3. WHEN I search with a pattern THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate regex patterns for each symbol type
4. IF a symbol type is specified THEN the system SHALL filter results to only that type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate seamlessly with VSCode's existing shortcuts, so that I can use familiar keyboard shortcuts without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Cmd+T (or Ctrl+T on Windows/Linux) THEN the system SHALL open the enhanced symbol search interface
2. WHEN the extension is active THEN it SHALL override or supplement the default VSCode symbol search
3. WHEN I use the search interface THEN it SHALL follow VSCode's standard UI patterns and keyboard navigation
4. IF the enhanced search fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to VSCode's default symbol search

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the search to work specifically with Python files and syntax, so that I can find Python classes, functions, and variables efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching in a Python repository THEN the system SHALL support Python files (.py, .pyx, .pyi)
2. WHEN processing Python files THEN the system SHALL recognize classes, functions, methods, variables, and imports
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show Python-specific context like decorators and class inheritance
4. IF other file types are present THEN the system MAY perform basic text-based pattern matching as a fallback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the search to be configurable, so that I can customize the search behavior to match my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN I SHALL be able to specify file patterns to include or exclude from search
2. WHEN setting up the extension THEN I SHALL be able to configure custom regex patterns for different symbol types
3. WHEN using the extension THEN I SHALL be able to toggle between fuzzy matching and exact matching modes
4. IF performance is an issue THEN I SHALL be able to limit the search scope to specific directories or file types
